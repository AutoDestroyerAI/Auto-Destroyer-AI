Auto Destroyer AI is an innovative project that combines neural networks, blockchain technology, and the classic destroyer game to create a self-learning AI system driven by blockchain transactions.

## Features

- **Neural Network Integration**: Implements a sophisticated neural network architecture for autonomous decision-making
- **Blockchain-Driven Movement**: destroyer movements are triggered by real-time blockchain transactions
- **Adaptive Learning**: Self-improves through genetic algorithms and reinforcement learning
- **Visual Neural Network**: Real-time visualization of neural network decision-making process
- **Transaction Monitor**: Live monitoring of blockchain transactions affecting the destroyer's behavior
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive web interface that works on both desktop and mobile devices

## Technical Architecture

### Neural Network
- Input Layer: 24 neurons for environmental perception
- Hidden Layer: 16 neurons for data processing
- Output Layer: 4 neurons for directional decision making
- Activation Function: Sigmoid for non-linear transformation

### Blockchain Integration
